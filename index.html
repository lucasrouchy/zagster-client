<h1>Zagster Bike Share in Bend</h1>
<h2 id="rideCount"> About </h2>
<p> This is my data visualization for the amount of rides each month in 2017. As you can see July came in as the most active month with 405 rides. I chose to illustrate the amount of rides each month to really see how the seasons and weather affected bike sharing. The data for this project comes from the raw data from the zagster database.  </p>
